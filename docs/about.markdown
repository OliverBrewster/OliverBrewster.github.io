This is a place for me to centralise all the engineering work I've completed over the last few years.
There's a combination of stuff completed for my university course, ones undertaken with friends, and 
ones done for myself. 
\
\
The projects are all documented to the best standard, but I have done my best to fill in the gaps
and describe the interesting parts of each project.
