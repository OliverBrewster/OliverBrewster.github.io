This is a place for me to centralise all engineering work I've completed over the last few years.
There's a combination of stuff completed for my university course, ones undertaken with friends, and 
ones done for myself. The documentation isn't always its best, but I have done my best to fill in the gaps
and describe the interesting parts of each project. Thanks for visiting!
