<!-- # RoboChess Project -->

<h3 id="project-summary">Project Summary:</h3>
<p>This was a solo project undertaken to automate the task of raising and lowering bedroom blinds. This was completed with simply using two lasers and photo-sensitive resistors to accurately measure the binary state of the blind position. A DC motor and driver were fitted inside of the blind for discrete actuation, and a simple arduino script was used for logic.</p>

<p>Although not the most technically complex project in the list, this is significant for its reliability and longevity. It has been changing state twice per day for 5 years with no need for maintenance so far!</p>
