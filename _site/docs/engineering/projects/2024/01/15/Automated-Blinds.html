<h3 id="project-summary">Project Summary:</h3>
<p>The aim of this project is to develop a Desktop FDM hybrid machine to do both additive and subtractive manufacturing. This has been realised in the form of a modified IDEX machine with one additive tool (Hemera extruder) and one subtractive tool (CNC spindle). With only 3 axes, this system would be very limited in geometry which could be CNC milled. This is why 5-axes have been implemented by adding 2 additional rotation axes to the bed (one with axis parallel to y-axis and the other with axis parallel to z-axis), pictured below:</p>

<h3 id="current-project-state">Current Project State</h3>
<p>At present, the machine has been fully built and calibrated. All 5 axes are functional, and moves are controlled using GCODE via standard open-source printer hardware. The milling and additive head are independently controllable and can be swapped in and out of use (each using a slightly offset coordinate system). A stiffer gantry has been fitted to the machine, and the process has started for calibrating optimal CNC parameters. The machine has a ‘digital twin’ which can be used for generating 5-axis milling toolpaths and collision detection.</p>

<h3 id="outstanding-goals">Outstanding Goals</h3>
<p>The future goals for the project are the following:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Use Fusion to generate 3+2-axis milling toolpaths, and write post-processing script to combine with additive GCODE</li>
  <li>Write algorithm to generate optimal placements for model cuts to</li>
</ul>
