<!-- # RoboChess Project -->

<h3 id="project-summary">Project Summary:</h3>
<p>I proposed and lead this project for a full year with the robotics and additive manufacturing society (<a href="https://www.oxramsociety.org/">OxRAM</a>). The aim of the project was to create a fully automated chess board able to move the pieces under the board. The main design constraint of the board was its size, which was required to fit in a small footprint and have a simple interface (no more complicated to use than a pair of wireless headphones!). With 2 hours per week spent on the project, and 30 sessions completed to-date, the project has hit the following milestones:</p>
<ul>
  <li>64 hall effect sensor array and multiplexing is fully designed and smaller array fully tested and working</li>
  <li>Fully 3D printed motion system is working, with motion planner doing inverse kinematics to convert from cartesian (x,y) to (θ1,θ2) scara joint angles.</li>
  <li>Android app written and interacting with arduino through bluetooth module, and LiChess via their API.</li>
  <li>Magnetic engagement and release system tested to reliably move components</li>
  <li>Only <em>integration hell</em> remains….</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="contribution-to-project">Contribution to Project:</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Put together project proposal and recruited well-equipped team of 8 people to work on it.</li>
  <li>Joined one other in the magnetics/magnetics team to build the motion system and develop a magnetics setup that would work for reliably moving the pieces</li>
  <li>Developed the retraction mechanism using a servo actuated permenant magnet for engaging and disengaging pieces.</li>
  <li>Made the argument for scara-type mechanism for traversing X-Y space over cartesian mechanism using wires. Contributed to CADing (modifying parts for printability, and adding cable management to end effector using slip ring)</li>
  <li>Integrated retraction mechanism as end effector and tuned magnet/retraction height to consistently grip pieces.</li>
  <li>Advertised the project at the Oxford’s first RepRap festival and got featured by a popular 3D printing YouTuber!</li>
</ul>
